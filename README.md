# Seva Rybakov

My name is Seva and I'm an awesome full-stack web-developer. I'm 26, travel the world and do consulting for couple awesome *international remote top-talent companies* and *mentor other developers* because I love teaching stuff. Also, I've been a *CTO* @ 2 startups that I co-founded and been a *Head of Web Development Department* of small outsourcing company that I also co-founded back in Belarus before I realized how much I enjoy the remote lifestyle.
