# Seva Rybakov

My name is Seva and I'm an awesome full-stack web-developer. I'm 30, I travel the world and do consulting for a few awesome *international remote top-talent companies* and *mentor other developers* because I love to teach people technology! Also, I've been a *CTO* @ 2 startups that I co-founded and I've been a *Head of Web Development Department* of small outsourcing company that I also co-founded back in Belarus before I realized how much I enjoy the remote lifestyle.
